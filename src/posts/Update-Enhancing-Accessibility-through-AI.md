# Introduction
[According to WHO, approximately 16% of the world population has some form of disability](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health). As the population ages, the percentage is predicted to increase. This is due to the shift in age, as the population grows older, chronic conditions are more likely to manifest and impact quality of life. It is important to recognize that disabilities are not only centered around an individual, but also how environmental factors can serve as barriers, such as societal infrastructure and lack support for those with disabilities. These challenges perpetuate the limitations of interaction between an individual and their surroundings. Through using Artificial intelligence (AI), these barriers can be reduced and minimized for those who suffer from disabilities. AI is a branch of computer science where machines are programmed to operate and function in similar ways to the human mind. AI has many functions and is fundamentally a broad concept that can applied in many different situations. For the purposes of improving accessibility, AI learns and responds to processes called “machine learning”. Machine learning describes a branch of artificial intelligence where the AI models learn from sets of data to facilitate the task and process that it is to perform. This learning process is what improves the performance and the task that AI models programmed to do. By using sets of information and data related to individuals with disabilities ranging from cognitive to physical impairments, patterns are recognized, and solutions are generated to help address issues with current regulations surrounding accessibility. This development of AI has allowed for more innovation in technology and ways to assist in management of disabilities, by improving accessibility and quality of life. AI can create tools that are tailored specifically to the needs of an individual, which can be address both physical and cognitive needs. A popular term for these advancements is “Assistive Technology” (AT). AT includes products, services, strategies, and practices that aim to mitigate the effects of disabilities and the barriers that individuals face. AT allows for individuals to navigate their daily lives by assisting with activities and allowing for providing the support needed to live independently.

# AI and Machine Learning: Revolutionizing Accessibility
At the core of our exploration is the transformative power of AI and machine learning. These technologies are not just about emulating human intelligence; they are about surpassing traditional barriers, crafting assistive tools, and creating a more inclusive digital realm. From cognitive to physical impairments, AI's application in assistive technology (AT) is broadening horizons and improving the quality of life for many.

# Key Highlights from Our Review
**Interface Design for IDD:**   
AI is revolutionizing interface design, making technology accessible for individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities (IDD). By conforming to W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and leveraging AI algorithms, we're creating interfaces that cater to the unique needs of individuals across a spectrum of disabilities.   

**Assistive Technology and AIoT:**   
Assistive Technology (AT) is benefiting from AI, offering devices and services that improve the quality of life for those with physical impairments. The integration of AI with the Internet of Things (AIoT) is pushing the boundaries of what AT can achieve, from navigation systems for the blind to voice assistants that facilitate communication.   

**Voice AI:**   
Voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are making digital content more accessible, translating spoken words into text and vice versa. This technology is particularly beneficial for individuals with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.   

**Personalization and Adaptation:**   
AI's ability to learn user preferences and adapt interfaces accordingly is creating more personalized and accessible user experiences. Technologies such as autocorrect are evolving to support those with cognitive or motor impairments more effectively.

# Spotlight on Projects
- **Accessible Universal Diagrams through Language (AUDiaL):** A web-based interface that enables individuals with visual impairments to access charts and data through natural language.
- **WebAdapter Project:** Enhances web accessibility for the visually impaired and physically handicapped by adapting interface elements like fonts and color contrast.
- **eLearning Platforms:** Tailored online learning environments that address the diverse needs of people with disabilities, focusing on ease of use and personalization.
- **Endeavor Connect:** A simplified Facebook interface designed to support independent use by individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ID).
- **Net Haver:** A social media interface for those with IDD, facilitating communication through symbols and pictures.

# Conclusion
The intersection of AI and accessibility is fostering an environment where technology not only serves but empowers individuals with disabilities. Our review highlights the significant strides being made in interface design, assistive technologies, and personalized solutions. As we continue to explore this dynamic field, our commitment to improving accessibility and quality of life remains steadfast.
